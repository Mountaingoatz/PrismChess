# Spin Chess

**Chess with a twist — rotate 2×2 grids on the board to reshape the battlefield.**

Spin Chess is a chess variant played on a standard 8×8 board with one addition: the middle four rows (rows 3–6) are divided into eight 2×2 grids that players can rotate 180° on their turn.

## How to Play

- **Every turn:** Make one piece move (mandatory) and optionally rotate one grid (before or after your move).
- **Rotation:** Tap any of the 8 grids in the rotation zone to spin it 180°. All four squares swap diagonally.
- **Win conditions:** Traditional checkmate, or use a rotation to expose the opponent's king and capture it in the same turn.
